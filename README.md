# Amazing Amazons

A project for developing high-intelligence AI bots for the Game of Amazons, designed to compete on the [Botzone platform](https://www.botzone.org.cn/).

## Overview

This is a new version of the previous AmazingAmazons project, focused on creating competitive AI bots using advanced techniques like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and sophisticated evaluation functions. The project currently features bot001, a multi-component MCTS implementation that utilizes Botzone's long-running mode for optimal performance.

### The Game: Amazons

- **Board**: 8×8 grid
- **Pieces**: Each player (Black/White) has 4 amazons
- **Movement**: Amazons move like chess queens (8 directions, any distance)
- **Turn Structure**: 
  1. Move one amazon to an empty square
  2. Shoot an arrow from the new position to place an obstacle
- **Win Condition**: Opponent cannot make any legal move
- **First Move**: Black moves first

## Current Status

✅ **Complete**: Bot001 C++ port, testing infrastructure, bot002 optimized version, tournament validation, comprehensive bot interface documentation, and five new optimization bots (004-008)  
⚠️ **Blocked**: Bot002 has persistent TLE (Time Limit Exceeded) issue, awaiting expert consultation  
📅 **In Progress**: Systematic testing of optimization techniques via competition automation

**Recent Updates** (January 8, 2026):
- **Created bot009.cpp by integrating opponent.cpp weights into bot003** ✅
  - **Improvement**: Uses sophisticated 28x6 weight array from opponent.cpp instead of EARLY/MID/LATE weights
  - **Implementation**: 
    - Replaced EARLY/MID/LATE weight arrays with opponent.cpp's ARGS array
    - Updated `get_phase_weights()` to use opponent.cpp's 28-turn weight progression
    - Uses only first 5 weights from each row (opponent.cpp has 6 components)
  - **Compilation**: `g++ -std=c++11 -O2 -o bots/bot009 bots/bot009.cpp`
  - **Testing**: Verified with basic test input, produces valid moves
  - **Status**: Fully functional and ready for testing against other bots

**Recent Updates** (December 26, 2025):
- **Created five new C++ bots with optimization techniques** ✅
  - **bot004.cpp**: Move ordering heuristics (sorts moves by centrality and arrow proximity)
  - **bot005.cpp**: Transposition table (caches evaluations using Zobrist hashing)
  - **bot006.cpp**: Progressive widening (limits child expansion based on node visits)
  - **bot007.cpp**: Bitboard representation (3x uint64_t for faster operations)
  - **bot008.cpp**: Adaptive time management (dynamic time allocation based on game phase)
  - **Status**: All bots created, compiled, and ready for systematic testing

- **Created competition automation system** ✅
  - **Script**: `scripts/run_competitions.py`
  - **Purpose**: Automate 10-game competitions between each new bot and bot003
  - **Features**: Sequential execution (respects memory constraints), detailed results collection, JSON output, markdown reports
  - **Output**: Results in `results/competitions/`, analysis reports in `docs/analysis/`
  - **Status**: System operational, initial tests completed

- **Initial competition results** ⚠️
  - **Test**: Ran 1-game competitions for each bot vs bot003
  - **Findings**: Some bots have TLE issues (bot004, bot008) and protocol issues (bot007)
  - **Analysis**: Reports generated in `docs/analysis/` directory
  - **Next**: Full 10-game competitions needed for statistical significance

**Previous Updates** (December 25, 2025):
- **Bot Interface Documentation Created**: Comprehensive documentation for GUI integration ✅
  - **Location**: `docs/interfaces/` directory
  - **Purpose**: Enable GUI developers to integrate Amazing Amazons AI bots into their applications
  - **Documents Created**: 4 comprehensive interface documents
  - **Status**: Documentation complete and ready for GUI developers

- **Tournament System Manual Created**: Comprehensive user guide for tournament testing infrastructure ✅
  - **Document**: `docs/manuals/tournament_system_manual.md`
  - **Contents**: Overview, installation, bot requirements, CLI commands, running matches/tournaments, testing bots, compiling bots, troubleshooting, architecture, best practices
  - **Status**: Manual complete and ready for users

**Previous Updates** (December 15, 2025):
- **Bot002 TLE Request Document Created**: Comprehensive bug solution request for DeepSeek ✅
  - **Problem**: Bot002 still experiences TLE despite previous fixes (0.7s/1.4s limits + mid-iteration check)
  - **Symptom**: Bot reaches 951ms → 1000ms TLE in late-game despite 700ms limit + 150ms safety buffer
  - **Analysis**: ~300-450ms unaccounted time, late-game 3-5x slowdown, first turn anomaly
  - **Document**: `docs/requests/tle_bug_solution_request.md` with comprehensive timing analysis
  - **Questions**: 8 diagnostic questions for DeepSeek covering timing, overhead, and optimization
  - **Status**: Request document ready, will be provided with source code and logs to DeepSeek

**Previous Updates** (December 14, 2025):
- **Bot002 Runtime Error (RE) Fix**: Fixed SIGSEGV segmentation fault crashes ✅
  - **Root Cause**: Custom NodePool allocator used `vector::resize()` which invalidated all node pointers when reallocating memory
  - **Symptom**: Bot crashed on Turn 7 with signal 11 after 6 successful turns
  - **Solution** (from DeepSeek):
    1. Replaced NodePool with `std::deque<MCTSNode>` for pointer stability
    2. Removed tree reuse (`advance_root()`) - rebuild tree each turn
    3. Added `reset()` method to clear tree between turns
  - **Trade-offs**: Slightly slower (no tree reuse) but 100% stable with simpler code
  - **Documentation**: `docs/bots/implementations/bot002_re_fix.md` and `docs/requests/re_bug_solution_request.md`
  - Git commit: dce4e5c
  
- **Bot002 Critical Bug Fixes**: Fixed TWO major bugs causing illegal moves on Botzone ✅
  - **Bug 1 - MCTS Selection Phase**: Wrong player color used (`1 - node->player_just_moved` instead of correct `node->player_just_moved`)
    - Impact: Corrupted simulation state, MCTS tree diverged from actual board
  - **Bug 2 - Replay Loop**: Applied both request and response lines from Botzone
    - Impact: Each move applied twice with alternating colors, corrupting bitboard via XOR operations
    - Fix: Only process odd-indexed lines (actual responses), skip even-indexed duplicates
  - Added defensive assertion in DEBUG mode for early error detection
  - Updated .clinerules with sequential testing requirement
  - Comprehensive documentation: `docs/bots/implementations/bot002_illegal_move_fix.md`
  - Git commit: a6ea4d3
  
- **Status**: Bot002 fully fixed (both illegal moves and crashes), stable, and ready for Botzone deployment
- **Task Completion Workflow Enhanced**: Improved workflow to enforce mandatory sequential execution
  - Problem: Steps were being skipped, memory bank files not reviewed before updates
  - Solution: Complete rewrite of `.clinerules/workflows/task_completion.md`
  - Added mandatory 4-step sequence: (1) Review ALL memory bank files → (2) Update files one by one → (3) Update README → (4) Clear git status
  - Multiple safeguards: Warning messages, checkpoints, "STOP HERE" instructions, completion checklist
  - Result: Workflow now prevents skipping steps and ensures thorough updates
- **Bot002 Tournament Testing**: 20 games vs bot001 - **ZERO CRASHES**
  - Fixed critical crash bugs (move replay logic, input validation, defensive checks)
  - Results: Bot001 won 16 games (80%), Bot002 won 4 games (20%)
  - Bot002 faster (1.128s/move) but strategically weaker than bot001 (1.776s/move)
  - Average game length: 25.9 turns

**Previous Updates** (December 13, 2025):
- **Created bot002.cpp**: Optimized version with bitboard representation
  - Bitboard move generation (3x uint64_t vs 8x8 array)
  - Fast BFS with fixed arrays and on-the-fly accumulation
  - Xorshift64 PRNG, node pool allocator
  - Move ordering heuristic (root only)
- **Fixed critical Botzone crash issues**:
  - Removed expensive move ordering from inner loops (was called on every node!)
  - Conservative time limits: 1.6s/0.8s (vs 2s/1s limits)
  - Reduced memory overhead, fixed pool reset bug
- Compiled with aggressive flags: -O3 -march=native -flto

**Previous Updates** (November 12, 2025):
- Created comprehensive optimization request document for expert consultation
- Documented current performance bottlenecks (move generation 35%, BFS 30%, memory 15%)
- Prepared 10 specific optimization questions with code snippets
- Target: 50-100% more MCTS iterations through optimization

**Previous Updates** (December 10, 2025):
- Created C++ port of bot001 (4x faster, production-ready)
- Built comprehensive testing infrastructure (3 test scripts)
- Ran 50-game tournament: Python vs C++ (equal strength confirmed)
